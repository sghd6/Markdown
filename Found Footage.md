**Found Footage:**

##REC 2

This sequel to the popular *REC* follows a SWAT team as they infiltrate an apartment whose residents have been infected by a demonic virus. This film uses the body-cams of the offericers to their full potential, giving the viewer a first-person-shooter style experience. The claustraphobic action combined with the mystery of the virus provides an intense horror narrative. This and the orginal *REC* would make a great double feature for those who want to get their hearts racing.
