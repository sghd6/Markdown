**Found Footage:**

##REC 2

This sequel to the popular *REC* follows a SWAT team as they infiltrate an apartment whose residents have been infected by a demonic virus. This film uses the body-cams of the offericers to their full potential, giving the viewer a first-person-shooter style experience. The claustraphobic action combined with the mystery of the virus provides an intense horror narrative. This and the orginal *REC* would make a great double feature for those who want to get their hearts racing. 


##Be My Cat: A Film For Anne

This microbudget horror flick follows a disturbes filmmaker whose dream is to one day work with Anne Hathaway. What this slow-burn film does best is creating a feeling of unease and discomfort. The way the main character interacts with the people around him has such a sense of awkwardness that I couldn't tell whether the interactions were actually genuine. It's loose narrative and small cast keep one guessing as to how things will escalate next. If you are in the mood for blood and cringe, *Be My Cat* is the chioce for you. 

##Cloverfield

This adrenaline-pumping flick follows a grouo of friends teying to escape New York in the midst of a monster rampaging through the city. Although the camera-movements can create a feeling of motion sickness, the imagery created does a great job of showcasing the panic these characters feel. The monster is glroious in its display, appearing hauntingly large and ravanous. *Cloverfield* creates a great atmosphere that honestly should have been built-upon in a more direct sequel. If you are a fan of the giant monster subgenre, then *Cloverfield* deserves a spot on your must see list.
