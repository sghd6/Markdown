Just in time for the holiday season, this Christmas-themed slasher is one of the most influential horror flicks out there. The film centers on a group of sorority sisters being stalked by a mysterious killer.
The sound design and lighting make this a very tense experience with a unique winter aesthetic.
This film originated the quote "The call is coming from inside the house" and the proposed sequel later became John Carpenter's *Halloween*. The film is also noted for its pro-choice themes, which was very controversial
for the time. This is a classic that paved the road for horror movies to come.


## Hellraiser (2022)

I'm a cynic when it comes to remakes of classic horror movies. However, this remake does its own thing and that greatly benefits it. The characters in this movie are all sympathetic and do what they can to escape their unfair fates. The blood is phenomenal and the mechanics of the puzzle box feel well-defined while still leaving room to speculate. I think this is a great remake and an example of what can be done to spice up a classic.

This bloody cat-and-mouse flick follows a family being terrorized by a gang of masked maniacs. What I enjoy most about this one is the main character and how she tries to outwit her pursuers. She was raised by doomsday-preppers and has a knack for improvised traps as a result. Couple that with some good action and twists, and you have yourself a good time.
