**Lighter Side:**
Films that ease uo on the blood and gore in service of telling an interesting story.


##The Ring (2002)

This American remake tells the story of a mysterious video tape that kills people seven daysbafter watching it. This film is a classic for a reason. Its sickening lighting, expert sound design, and understandable characters craft a great mystery to keep the viewer engaged. The pacing is done really well in my opinion, tying in the ticking-clock element thatnplagues the main character. If you bever got the chance to check this one out, I recommend that you do so.
