## The Ring (2002)

This American remake tells the story of a mysterious videotape that kills people seven days after watching it. This film is a classic for a reason. Its sickening lighting, expert sound design, and understandable characters craft a great mystery to keep the viewer engaged. The pacing is done really well in my opinion, tying in the ticking-clock element that plagues the main character. If you never got the chance to check this one out, I recommend that you do so.

This thriller follows three girls kidnapped by a man with multiple personality disorder. James MacAvoy gives a very intense performance as the film's antagonist. There is a good build-up to the film's climax that blends well with the main character's tragic backstory. I follow M Night Shamalan's film career and can honestly say this is one of his best. 


## It Follows

This unique film follows a young woman being pursued by a demonic entity that slowly walks towards her. This film uses the gimmick to its full extent, with the characters strategizing how to out-run and beat the creature. The creeping camerawork matches how the creature moves and operates. *It Follows* is a great display of a simple concept being used to carry a narrative.
