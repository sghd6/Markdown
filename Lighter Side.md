**Lighter Side:**
Films that ease uo on the blood and gore in service of telling an interesting story.


##The Ring (2002)

This American remake tells the story of a mysterious video tape that kills people seven daysbafter watching it. This film is a classic for a reason. Its sickening lighting, expert sound design, and understandable characters craft a great mystery to keep the viewer engaged. The pacing is done really well in my opinion, tying in the ticking-clock element thatnplagues the main character. If you bever got the chance to check this one out, I recommend that you do so.

##Split

This thriller follows three girls kidnapped by a man with multiple personality disorder. James MacAvoy gives a very intense performance as the film's antagonist. There is a good build-up to the film's climax that blends well with the main characters tragic backstory. I follow M Night Shamalan's film career and can honestly say this is one of his best. 


##It Follows

This unique film follows a young woman being pursued by a demonic entity that slowly walks towards her. This film uses the gimmick to its full extent, with the characters strategizin how to out run and beat the creature. The creeping camerawork matches how the creature moves and operates. *It Follows* is a great display of a somple
concept being used to carry a narrative.
