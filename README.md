*A Guide to the Horror Genre*

[Slasher](https://github.com/sghd6/Markdown/blob/main/Slasher.md):
These are some classic slashers for those who enjoy a bloody, terrorizing experience.

[Found Footage](https://github.com/sghd6/Markdown/blob/main/Found%20Footage.md):
Although the genre can be very hit-and-miss with its style, there are some real gems to be found.

[Lighter Side](https://github.com/sghd6/Markdown/blob/main/Lighter%20Side.md):
If blood and violence is not for you, there are still horror movies that can provide you with a good time.

I hope this guide gave you some good recommendations. Thanks for stopping by.
