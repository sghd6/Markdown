*A Guide to the Horror Genre*

[Slasher](https://www.google.com/)
These are some classic slashers for those who enjoy a bloody, terrorizing experience.

[Found Footage](https://www.google.com/)
Although the genre can be very hit-and-miss with its style, there are some real gems to be found.

[Lighter Side](https://www.google.com/)
If blood and violence isn't for you, there are still horror movies that can still provide you a good time.

I hope this guide gave you some good recommendations. Thanks for stopping by.
